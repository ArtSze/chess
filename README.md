This is a chess game created as part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum: 
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project)

Run 'main.rb' in order to play!

It can be played by two human players, or an individual can play against themselves.

disclaimer: It could use some refactoring/reworking especially because of performance issues when a player's king
is in check. It will eventually continue working, but there is a bit of lag in those moments as it calculates legal/illegal moves
and whether or not the conditions for mate have been met.
